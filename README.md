# Mirror-Canvas
Mirror canvas is the one having the mirror image of the original canvas. 
In this project what you had made on original canvas is also created on the mirror canvas.

Both the canvases, the original and the mirror one, change its position depending on the width of the window(browser window). 

The mirror canvas is able to produce vertically reflected image as well as horizontally reflected image. A vertical reflection reflects a image vertically across the x-axis, while a horizontal reflection reflects a image horizontally across the y-axis.
